Captcha Animal protects your user registration and comments with a test of identifying two friendly animals.


== Description ==

Animal Captcha is a lightweight plugin for Wordpress that adds a captcha 
control on comments and register with a nice picture of an animal than any 
man knows, and yet a robot is unable to identify. It's nice, comfortable and very safe. 
Languages: English, Spanish, German, French and Portuguese. <a href="http://www.teoriza.com/captcha/example.php">Try a test</a>.

Features:
--------
  * Lightweight, it is proven successful in high traffic loads.
  * Supported languages: English, Spanish, German, French and Portuguese.
  * Includes 101 images of 37 animals.
  * Protects comments and user registration.
  * Every generated image is unique with random complex deformation techniques.
  * Multisite compatible (WPMU).
  * Animal Captcha Maker: Tool for creating and modifying animals quickly and easily.
  * Valid HTML.


Why use Captcha Animal?
--------
1. Security: this is the main reason the Internet is
   developments that address some captchas get code
   alphanumeric, with increasing success. However, if I could
   a machine to identify an animal! It is theoretically impossible.

2. Beauty: it's nice to see a picture of an ugly animal
   alphanumeric code.

3. Speed: Users save time because it takes less
   to identify and write an animal to enter a code
   random.

4. Effectiveness: the user gets it right with more likely in
   compared with recent insurance captchas.


Minor disadvantages:
--------
1. Language: Animal Captcha accepts animal names in English, Spanish, 
   German, French and Portuguese simultaneously. It's easy to add more 
   languages, just palabas must be added the names of the files. But
   this is an obvious limitation. In most blogs is more than
   enough to have English and Spanish, but if your blog is
   one of these languages will have to wait for better translation.

2. If your blog requires a high level of security is highly desirable to create a directory
   own animals and unpublished. That is, each image should be replaced by another
   photo of the animal you have chosen and cut your particular way. Of
   Thus security is 100% until proven otherwise (they have
   passed tests for 2 years).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Is it multilanguage?

	Yes. For now accepts English, Spanish, German, French and Portuguese. But you can easily add your own 
	language by simply changing the file names.

2. What if an animal has several synonym names?

	No problem. We accept several names for the same animal. For example, eagle 
	and hawk are accepted as correct.

3. Is it vulnerable to a simple brute force attack?

	No. We have implemented measures to mitigate the natural vulnerability of the 
	system. There are 37 different animals and by default shows 2 at a time. This 
	means that 1.369 requests should be made to achieve success only by brute force. 
	Configuring the test of 3 animals would take 50.653 requests for a single hit 
	by brute force. Nonetheless, she is preparing a new version with many more animals 
	(perhaps even objects) and display settings for N animals.

	With this you can get an idea of the seriousness with which Animal Captcha is 
	designed on computer security.

4. How much security?

	~~It is very secure in its default configuration. Security experts have tried brute 
	force and identification of patterns without success. Still, as with any captcha, 
	it is anticipated that with enough effort can be broken. If you require a near 100% 
	security, quiet sleep, we recommend creating a directory of their own animals, which 
	is not public.~~
	Now, none.
